title: run claxx-dev-jekyll like github org page

just accidentally removed about 3-4 posts because of file moving...

yey! so dumb...

should open a posts repo on github...

fix this jekyll site to be served like github.org page... not like it's a project page. this is so that even if the url don't get resolved on github-pages, i can serve up the _site/ build on surge.should
to do this, we'll have to learn about baseurl config and siteurl config...

when that get's fixed, we'll keep that as the blog site for daily build log...

...desu.
